We just released a [new version][github-release] of Statusfy with new big features that can improve the user experience of your Status Page System: ***Scheduled Maintenance***, ***Notifications***, and ***Sitemap***.


## Scheduled Maintenance

[Scheduled Maintenances][docs-scheduled-maintenance] definition is a way to let your users know ahead of time when your system(s) cannot handle requests due to a temporary maintenance update.

We tried to keep the definition of Scheduled Maintenance as simple as possible sharing the same parameters as regular incidents but adding two new parameters: [***scheduled***][docs-scheduled-maintenance] and [***duration***][docs-scheduled-maintenance].


## Notifications

With the new [Notifications feature][docs-notifications], you can keep your users notified with any Incidents update your System may have. Viewers of your Status Page can access the Choices bellow by clicking a Subscribe button.

- **Atom and RSS Feed:** These feeds include all past Incidents and Scheduled Maintenances. Your users can use Feeds Readers or tools like [IFTT][iftt-rss] and [Zapier][zapier-rss] to receive updates from these feeds.
- **iCalendar:** Your users can subscribe to a calendar containing all of your upcoming and past Scheduled Maintenances. The calendar is published using iCalendar, a popular format which is supported by most modern calendar applications.
- **Twitter:** Define Twitter accounts that your users can access in order to receive updates.
- **Support Site:** Define an external Support Site your users can access in order to receive updates from other sources you may want to provide.

***Most of these Notifications Choices are enabled by default but you can disable them in your config file. More info [here][docs-docs-notifications].***

## Sitemap

Now you can notify to  the search engine bots the available pages in your Status Page System with a **Sitemap**. This can help all the pages in your system to be found more easily.
