We just released a [new version][github-release] of Statusfy with new features and performance improvements: Docker support, new commands, three new languages translate the Interface and more.

## CLI

Two new commands are now available: [`delete-incident`][delete-incident] and [`update-incident`][delete-incident]. They are useful if you're managing a huge amount of incidents or multiple languages.

## Scheduled Maintenance

We apply minor improvements to the layout of the Scheduled Incidents: the end date is now displayed as well as the incident content. You can also customize the [position of this section][scheduled-position], choosing one of these options: `belowSystems`, `aboveSystems`, and `aboveGlobalStatus`.

## Docker

We now officially support [Docker][docker]. We don't recommend it for production yet, we need your feedback first in order to make sure that the image works properly.

## New translations:

Three new languages translate the Interface:

  * German (thanks to [Dennis Herzberg](https://github.com/dennis47528))
  * Hungarian (thanks to [Peter Borsa](https://github.com/asrob))
  * Portuguese from Brazil (thanks to [felipeklasen](https://github.com/felipeklasen))

If you're using one of these languages, you no longer need to manually provide a translation file ðŸ¤“.
