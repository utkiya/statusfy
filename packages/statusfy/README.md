# Statusfy

> A marvelous Open Source Status Page system

Statusfy is a Status Page System, easy to use and completely Open Source. You can easily create a fast System either [**Static Generated**](https://docs.statusfy.co/guide/architecture.html#static-generated) or [**Server Rendered**](https://docs.statusfy.co/guide/architecture.html#server-rendered) and easily deploy it to a variety of [hosting services](https://docs.statusfy.co/guide/deploy.html).

A Statusfy site is a Web Application, created with [Vue][vue], [Nuxt.js][nuxt] and [Tailwind CSS][tailwindcss]. We use **Vue** to dynamically define the interfaces that represent the data, **Nuxt.js** to make a quick and useful abstraction of the client and server logic, and **Tailwind CSS** to rapidly define the default theme.


## Features

- Systems Definition
- Incidents Reports
- Progressive Web App (PWA) Support
- Google Analytics Integration
- Multi-language support
- A default theme with:
  - Responsive layout
  - Easy Customization
  - Beautiful Design 
- SEO Friendly
- Hosting flexibility: Static Generated or Server Rendered
